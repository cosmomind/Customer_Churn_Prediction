## Customer Churn Prediction Model for Internet Service Provider
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for an Internet Service Provider using a dataset from Kaggle. By applying data preprocessing techniques and optimizing machine learning models, the project aims to accurately identify customers who are likely to churn.

# Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Performed EDA, handled missing values, conducted outlier removal, and feature engineering on the customer churn dataset.
- **Model Implementation and Comparison**: Implemented and compared RandomForestClassifier and LogisticRegression models, achieving accuracies of 0.94 and 0.92 respectively.
- **Cross Validation**: Optimized model performance using K-fold cross-validation .
- **Web Application Development**: Developed a Flask web application for real-time churn prediction based on user inputs.
